# Costco-Sales-Performance-Analysis

### Project Background 
Costco, a American multinational corporation founded in 1983, specializes in being one of the leading global suppliers of groceries. I'm partnering with their sales team to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales and marketing teams. Our analysis is spread across two dashboards: Sales Dashboard, Customer Dashboard.

### Objectives  
- **Annual Comparison:**  
  - Showcase total **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity of Sales** for each year, with a year-over-year comparison highlighted.
  - Identify and display the highest and lowest points of each year for **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity of Sales**.  
- **Subcategory Insights:**  
  - Analyze **Sales** and **Profit** for each subcategory.  
      - Highlight subcategories where **Sales** were lower than the previous year (**red**).
      - Highlight subcategories that had a profit in blue, highlight those that did not profit in red.
- **Performance Averages:**  
  - Highlight areas where **Sales** and **Profit** were above or below the average for the current year, emphasizing trends with color coding (**red** for below average, **blue** for above average). 

### Executive summary
Across the timeframe of 4 years the trend for sales has remained consistent, each year sales is at the lowest point of time at the beginning of the year and reaches its peak at the end of the year. It had a stagnant start with very little difference between sales of 2020 and 2021 followed by healthy growth in each of the subsequent years 2022 and 2023.

### Insights

  - Costco sales from 2020 to the end of 2023 started slow, there were very minor difference of -2.8% in sales from the year 2020 to 2021 followed by sustained healthy substainal growth from 2021 to 2023 a growth of sales averaging 25% per year.
  - **2020–2021:**  
    - The business had small loss in profits of -2.8% going from $484K in Sales to $474K in Sales
  - **2021–2023:**  
    - Following the decline, a clear and consistent upward trend emerged for the years 2021 to 2023.
    - From 2021 to 2022, sales increased by 30%, reaching $609K. Next from 2022 to 2023, sales increased by 20% to $733K

- **Profit:**
  - Costco's profit from 2020 to 2023 saw a consistent increase each year averaging to 24% Increase in profit per year. 

- **Quantity:**
  - Costco's quantity of orders from 2020 to 2023 saw a consistent increase each year the increase from 2020 to 2021 was low a 5% but subsequent years had large increase at 23% and 27% respectively.

- **Subcategory's** (Profit and Sales, 2022 and 2023 comparison)
  - Tables was the third best in sales in 2023 increasing by a significant margin of 55% compared to its previous year. However as a subcategory it still suffered a lost in profit of $3k, this was the biggest loss of profit in the year. This indicates that the prices for chairs were moved too low so that even with more sales it could not recover its costs made to produce the tables.
  - Copier's has the largest profit of $18K putting it signficantly ahead of all other subcategories with a difference between 2nd and 1st of $8K. It also had a large increase in sales of 89% compared to its previous year.
