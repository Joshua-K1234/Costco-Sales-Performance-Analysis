## Thoughts
I am happy how the dashboard turned out, it uses 2 colours to clearly show postive and negative information about the profit and sales. The components where spread out and the use of tooltips gives an extra level of depth. This dashboard has 2 pages and filters.

# Report

### Project Background - Scenario
Costco, a American multinational corporation founded in 1983, specializes in being one of the leading global suppliers of groceries. I'm partnering with their sales team to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales and marketing teams. Our analysis is spread across two dashboards: Sales Dashboard, Customer Dashboard.

### Objectives  
- **Annual Comparison:**  
  - Showcase total **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity of Sales** for each year, with a year-over-year comparison highlighted.
  - Identify and display the highest and lowest points of each year for **Sales**, **Profit**, and **Quantity of Sales**.  
- **Subcategory Insights:**  
  - Analyze **Sales** and **Profit** for each subcategory.  
      - Highlight subcategories where **Sales** were lower than the previous year (**red**).
      - Highlight subcategories that had a profit in blue, highlight those that did not profit in red.
- **Performance Averages:**  
  - Highlight areas where **Sales** and **Profit** were above or below the average for the current year, emphasizing trends with color coding (**red** for below average, **blue** for above average). 

### Key Insights
Across the timeframe of 4 years the trend for sales has remained consistent, each year sales is at the lowest point of time at the beginning of the year and reaches its peak at the end of the year. It had a stagnant start with very little difference between sales of 2020 and 2021 followed by healthy growth in each of the subsequent years 2022 and 2023.

### Insights
- **Sales:**
  - Costco sales from 2020 to the end of 2023 started slow, there were very minor difference of -2.8% in sales from the year 2020 to 2021 followed by sustained healthy substainal growth from 2021 to 2023 a growth of sales averaging 25% per year.
  - Sales show seasonality, each year sales is at the lowest point of time at the beginning of the year and reaches its peak at the end of the year.
  - **2020–2021:**  
    - The business had small loss in profits of -2.8% going from $484K in Sales to $474K in Sales
  - **2021–2023:**  
    - Following the decline, a clear and consistent upward trend emerged for the years 2021 to 2023.
    - From 2021 to 2022, sales increased by 30%, reaching $609K. Next from 2022 to 2023, sales increased by 20% to $733K

- **Profit:**
  - Costco's profit from 2020 to 2023 saw a consistent increase each year averaging to 24% Increase in profit per year. 

- **Quantity:**
  - Costco's quantity of orders from 2020 to 2023 saw a consistent increase each year the increase from 2020 to 2021 was low a 5% but subsequent years had large increase at 23% and 27% respectively.

- **Subcategory's** (Profit and Sales, 2022 and 2023 comparison highest and lowest profit)
  - Tables
    - **Tables** was the third best in sales in 2022 increasing by a significant margin of 55% compared to its previous year. However as a subcategory it still suffered a lost in profit of $3k, this was the **biggest loss of profit** in the year. This indicates that the prices for chairs were moved too low so that even with more sales it could not recover its costs made to produce the tables.
    - This got worse in 2023 where it had the same sales but an even bigger loss in profit of -$8K, it was also the highest loss in profit for that year.
  - Copiers
    - Copier's has the largest profit of $18K in 2022 putting it signficantly ahead of all other subcategories with a difference between 2nd and 1st of $8K. It also had a large increase in sales of 89% compared to its previous year.

### Recommendations
**Reduce the loss of profit:** The profit of tables each year is leading to increasing losses of profit each year -3K$ in 2022, -$8K in 2023 with no difference in the quantity of sales in these years and is also the biggest loss of profit in each of these years. I would recommend seeing if there is anything that can be done to increase the profitablity of tables. To mitigate losses I would suggest to reduce the production of tables for the year 2024 and focus on trying to improve the profit with what's left.

**Keep doing what's profitable:** The subcategory copiers has remained on top by a wide margin in terms of profit, outshining every other subcategory. Focus on sustaining strategies that drive its success.
